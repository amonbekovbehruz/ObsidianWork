	[CreditID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[BillingStartDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[BillingEndDate] [date] NULL
)
```

The `Credits.RevolvingWindows` table is used in a banking context to manage and track the billing periods of revolving credit accounts. Revolving credit accounts, such as credit cards or lines of credit, have billing cycles during which transactions are recorded, and at the end of each cycle, the account balance is billed to the customer.

Why this table is important:

### 1. **Tracking Billing Cycles**:

- **CreditID**: Identifies the specific credit account. This is essential for linking billing cycle data to the correct account.
- **BillingStartDate**: Marks the beginning of a billing cycle. This is the date from which transactions will be counted for the current billing period.
- **BillingEndDate**: Marks the end of a billing cycle. This is the date by which all transactions within the cycle are recorded and billed to the customer.

### 2. **Billing and Payments**:

- **BillingStartDate** and **BillingEndDate** help the bank determine the period within which transactions are aggregated to calculate the customer's bill.
- The bank can use this information to generate statements, assess interest, and track due dates for payments.

### 3. **Interest Calculation**:

- The dates help in calculating interest and fees accurately based on the account balance within each billing cycle.
- Accurate tracking of billing periods is crucial for applying correct interest rates and avoiding disputes with customers.

### 4. **Customer Communication**:

- The bank can inform customers about their billing cycle periods, so they know when their payments are due.
- This helps in improving transparency and customer satisfaction by providing clear information about billing cycles.
